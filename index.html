               I am <a id="mynameabout">Nikhil Bansal</a>, Physics Master student at <a id="mynameabout">IISER Mohali</a>. I am an Aspiring theoretical Physicist in the field of Quantum Information and Computation. Currently, I am exploring various fields related to QIC like Quantum error correction, Open Quantum systems and Quantum causal Model. Previously, I have explored some of the Non perturbative methods in Quantum field theory. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 15x; line-height: 2.0;">
                Other than physics, I also like to do programming. In hobbies, I like to play chess, table tennis and minecraft. I am also getting into hobbies of playing flute and reading books. I have been a great fan of mystery genre liking Detectice Conan and Holmes. The background images on this website are taken by me so I am also trying to learn photography a litte.
